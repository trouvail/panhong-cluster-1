In directory samba:/tmp/cvs-serv18132

Modified Files:
	util.c 
Log Message:
added some more debug info to the "EOF in map_ptr" error message to
try to make it easier to track down what is going wrong. 

Jarom, can you let me know what output this gives?

PS: the cvs commit messages for rsync are now sent to the rsync
mailing list. This will allow everyone to see what changes are being
made.

Update of /data/cvs/rsync
In directory samba:/tmp/cvs-serv7138

Modified Files:
	flist.c main.c proto.h rsync.1 rsync.c util.c 
Log Message:
added a --relative (== -R) option. This is what Anthony Thyssen
suggested on the list recently. See the man page entry for details but
basically it changes the behaviour so that paths are not stripped,
thus allowing you to specify a single rsync command to sync lots of
directories/files while preserving the full path name of each file.

also fixed a bug in the handling of umasks when both the source and
destination machines are local. We need to reset the umask before the
exec to ensure that the child gets a correct umask.

Log Message:
several changes:

- by popular demand I have changed the behaviour of the --delete
option. It should now work as "expected" for even those people silly
enough not to read the man page. rsync will now only look for
candidate files/directories to delete in directories that are
explicitly transferred from the sender

- updated the README a bit

- try to fail a bit more gracefully when rsync runs out of disk
space. I don't think this issues is fully resolved yet

Update of /data/cvs/rsync
In directory samba:/tmp/cvs-serv540

Modified Files:
	exclude.c flist.c rsync.c 
Log Message:
some people are now using rsync as a public server, using various
patches or wrappers. One problem with this is that rsync was not
written with this in mind and wasn't very careful about possible stack
overflows etc which could lead to security breaches. This wasn't a
problem when run in the traditional way as any user that can run rsync
can login anyway and cause much more damage that way.

This patch attempts to close possible stack overflow problems. I've
checked for all strcpy(), strcat(), sprintf() and memcpy()
overflows. I would appreciate it if someone else with a devious mind
could also go through the rsync source code and see if there are any
other stack overflows possible. Let me know if you do.

Log Message:

A set of patches from Christopher Chan-Nui <channui@austin.ibm.com>.

- better cleanup in case of error conditions. rsync now uses setpgrp()
to put all processes in one group then on a fatal error condition
(such as out of disk space) it will kill all members of this group

- added -L (--copy-links) option. With this option symbolic links and
treated like ordinary files.

- added -W (--whole-file) option. This option disables the normal
rsync incremental algorithm, making rsync send all data. Useful when
both source and destination are local

This implements uid/gid mapping. A map of uids/gids and the

transfers between systems that have different uid/gid maps.

The old behaviour can be selected using the --numeric-ids option.

The special uid 0 and the special group id 0 are never mapped, they
are always sent as numeric ids.

a large change to make rsync much more memory efficient. This is done
in 3 ways:

1) the realloc is done on a list of pointers, not a list of structures
2) only the basename of the file is now kept in the file struct an a
   util function f_name() is now used to access the full name when
   required.
3) pointers to directory names are re-used

hopefully I haven't broken anything. This will need lots of testing.

Log Message:
finished 64 bit file offset support. Hopefully rsync can now transfer
files up to 2^64 bytes in size. Now I just need to find enough disk
space to test this :-)

The 64 bit offset code only works if off_t is 64 bits (or bigger!) on
both ends of the link. If one end tries to send a file greater than
2^31 in size and the other end doesn't support it then rsync will
abort.

This commit also cleans up some static declarations so they are in a
unitinitialised segment to save load time.

rsync tries to copy a normal file but the destination contains a
directory of the same name. Normally rsync will refuse to do a
recursive directory deletion in such cases, by using --force the
recursive deletion will be done.

Log Message:

when using -x to stop at filesystem boundaries, include the mount
points but not their contents.

I did this by calling stat() on the directory above the current
directory and checking to see if it has the correct st_dev. Hopefully
this will work for most systems.

Note that the permissions and ownership on the mount point cannot be
copied correctly as they are unavailable while the filesystem is
mounted. Instead rsync will set the permissions and ownership to those
of the root directory of the mounted filesystem (ie. the apparent
permissions/ownership of the directory)

Modified Files:
	exclude.c flist.c io.c main.c match.c rsync.1 rsync.c rsync.h 
Log Message:

- added an internal io_error flag. Whenever an io error occurs (such
as not being able to open a directory) this flag is set and propogated
to the other end. When this flag is set the --delete code is
disabled. This prevents the problem that io or permission errors could
cause files to be incorrectly deleted on the destination.

- added a --timeout option. This allows you to set an IO timeout in
seconds. If no io occurs in that time then rsync exits with a timeout
error.

- changed some FERROR fds to FINFO

Modified Files:
	exclude.c flist.c io.c proto.h uidlist.c util.c

avoid similar problems in future.

Update of /data/cvs/rsync
In directory samba:/tmp/cvs-serv4998

Modified Files:
	flist.c 
Log Message:

fixed a bug in handling the -c option and non-regular files. It hadn't
turned up before because Linux had a bug in the handling of NULL
pointers to read()/write() on pipes, so I never noticed the bug in my
testing.

I've also sent a patch to Linus.

In directory samba:/tmp/cvs-serv884

Modified Files:
	flist.c proto.h rsync.c rsync.h 
Log Message:

revamped the -delete code. The last few bugs with it revealed that it
had a fundamental flaw in the way it detected duplicate deletion
scanning (which is very important when -R is used). I now store
inode/device numbers and use those to do the detection. This should be
a much less fragile method.
